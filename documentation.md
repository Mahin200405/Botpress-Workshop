What you see on your screen now is Botpress Studio, where you'll be designing the workflow of your bot

## Some basic terms

Here are some basic terms to know before getting started

**Workspace** - The main environment in Botpress Studio, where you manage all your chatbots. It includes tools for building, testing, and deploying bots.

**Workflow** - A structured sequence of nodes and transitions that define how a chatbot interacts with users. It represents the chatbot's conversation logic.

**Nodes** - The building blocks of a workflow, each representing a step in the conversation. Nodes can contain messages, conditions, API calls, or actions. All nodes in your workflow will be between two nodes, start node and end node.

**Cards** - Elements inside a node that define specific actions, such as sending messages, capturing user input, or triggering integrations.

Now that you know these, lets start building!!

# Travel Website Chatbot

For this workshop, we will be building a chatbot for a travel blog. The remaining parts of this documentation is divided into sections, each named after the node we are using in the workflow.
